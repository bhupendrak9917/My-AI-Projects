Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand. They talk to each other with very low sounds. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them.

A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks. When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink.

There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans. A cat is sometimes called a kitty. A young cat is called a kitten. A female cat is called a queen. A male cat is called a tom. There are about 60 breeds of cat. Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as domestic shorthair (DSH) or domestic longhair (DLH). The word cat is also used for other felines. Felines are usually called either big cats or small cats. The big, wild cats are well known: lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, and cheetahs.

Cattle are large grazing animals with two-toed or cloven hooves and a four-chambered stomach. This stomach is an adaptation to help digest tough grasses. Cattle can be horned or polled (or hornless), depending on the breed. The horns come out on either side of the head above the ears and are a simple shape, usually curved upwards but sometimes down. Cattle usually stay together in groups called herds. One male, called a bull will usually have a number of cows in a herd as his harem. The cows usually give birth to one calf a year, though twins are also known to be born. The calves have long strong legs and can walk a few minutes after they are born, so they can follow the herd. Cattle are native to many parts of the world except the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. Cattle have been domesticated for about 9,000 years.

Over twenty different classifications have been proposed since 1900. Spiders live on every continent except for Antarctica, and in nearly every habitat with the exceptions of air and sea. Almost all spiders are predators, and most eat insects. They catch their prey in several ways. Some build a spider web, and some use a thread of silk that they throw at the insect. Some kinds of spiders hide in holes in the ground, then run out and grab an insect that walks by. Others will make web nets to throw at passing insects. Or they go out and simply attack their prey.

Sometimes they eat birds eggs and insects. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels do not store food.
